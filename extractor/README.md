# `âœ¨ CorePackages Extractor`

**Automatically extracts CorePackages from Roblox's CDN and processes them into a consumable format.**

</div>

## About

This program is designed to run autonomously every Roblox release. It works in multiple stages:

1. Download and extract the latest LuaPackages from Roblox's CDN. Currently, this only downloads the `LIVE` channel.

2. Process package source files and build a dependency graph for each package. This process uses the Rotriever `lock.toml` file to resolve dependencies.

3. Process source files and compute every license used by each package. This is a best-guess process, and if a license cannot be resolved for a source file with absolute certainty (currently > 95%) then the package will not be included in this repository or uploaded to any distribution platform.

4. TODO: Document the rest of the process

## About Package Licenses

To maintain legality, it is essential that the extractor correctly parses package licenses. As mentioned above, the extractor will attempt to match source license headers to a known license. If this cannot be done with above 95% certainty then the package *will not* be included in this public repository.

The dataset of known license headers that are matched against is located at [`datasets/license_headers.json`](datasets/license_headers.json).

If a package has dependencies (direct or transient) that are not appropriately licensed, then that package will also not be included. The extractor will automatically output information about packages that *are* appropriately licensed, but are blocked by a dependency from being included.
